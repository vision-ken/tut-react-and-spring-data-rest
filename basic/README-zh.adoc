= Part 1 - Basic 特性
:sourcedir: https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-react-and-spring-data-rest/tree/master

本文讲述了如何获得一个基础的Spring Data REST应用并运行起来.然后在此基础之上使用React.js构建一个简单的UI.


== Step 0 - 设置开发环境

从github上 {sourcedir}/basic[下载工程代码].

如果想从头开始, 访问 http://start.spring.io 然后选择:

* Rest Repositories
* Thymeleaf
* JPA
* H2
* Lombok (需要确定你的IDE是否支持.)

这个 demo 使用了 Java 8, Maven Project, 和最新稳定版的Spring Boot. 同时也使用了基于 http://es6-features.org/[ES6]的React.js. 这是一个干净的工程,然后你可以添加本文的代码,或者从git中获取.

== 在一开始的时候...

在一开始的时候你有一些数据.但是人们想通过各种手段访问数据。多年来，人们拼凑了很多MVC控制器，许多使用Spring强大的REST支持。但是做一遍又一遍的花费了很多时间。

如果你遵从以下假设,Spring Data REST会使问题变得简单:

* 开发人员使用支持存储库模型的Spring Data项目。
* 该系统使用良好的行业标准协议，如HTTP动词，标准化media类型和IANA认同的链接名称。

=== 声明你的domain

任何基于Spring数据REST的应用程序的基石是domain对象。对于本文，您将构建一个应用程序来跟踪公司的员工。 通过创建这样的数据类型来开始：

.src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/payroll/Employee.java
[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/payroll/Employee.java[tag=code]
----

* `@Entity` 是一个 JPA annotation, 表示在关系表中存储的整个类
* `@Id` 和 `@GeneratedValue`  JPA annotations 表示主键是自动生成的.
* `@Data` 是一个 Lombok annotation, 用于自动生成getters, setters, constructors, toString, hash, equals, 和其他.

这个实体用于跟踪员工信息, 比如姓名和工作描述等.

NOTE: Spring Data REST 并非局限于JPA. 它支持许多NoSQL数据存储.

== 定义存储库

Spring Data REST应用的另一个关键是创建一个相应的存储库定义.

.src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/payroll/EmployeeRepository.java
[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/payroll/EmployeeRepository.java[tag=code]
----

* 它继承了 Spring Data 公共的 `CrudRepository` ,然后声明了域类型和主键类型.

这就是全部我们要做的!实际上,如果它是最高级别且可见的,你甚至不需要annotate. 在你的IDE中打开 `CrudRepository`, 你会发现全部需要的方法已经定义好了.

NOTE: 如果有需要,Spring Data REST也可以支持 http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.definition[自定义的存储库] .

== 预加载demo

为了使应用工作,你需要象这样加载一些数据:

.src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/payroll/DatabaseLoader.java
[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/payroll/DatabaseLoader.java[tag=code]
----

* 这个class 使用了Spring的 `@Component` annotation所以会被`@SpringBootApplication`自动识别.
* 它实现了Spring Boot的 `CommandLineRunner` 接口,所以它会在所有bean创建和注册后运行.
* 它通过在构造函数中自动注入`EmployeeRepository`来存取数据.
* 带命令行参数的`run()` 方法会被调用,加载你的数据.

Spring Data最强大的功能之一就是可以为您编写JPA查询。 这不仅减少了开发时间，还降低了错误和错误的风险。 Spring Data在存储库类中 http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.details[查找方法名称] ，并计算出你需要的操作,包括保存,删除和查找。

这就是为什么我们可以写一个空接口来继承内建的保存,查询和删除操作功能.

== 调整root URI

Spring Data REST默认的根路径是 `/`. 因为你一般都会将web UI放在该路径,所以你需要修改root URI.

.src/main/resources/application.properties
----
include::src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

== 启动服务端

最后一步你需要使用Spring Boot写一个`public static void main`来获得一个完整的REST API.

.src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/payroll/ReactAndSpringDataRestApplication.java
[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/payroll/ReactAndSpringDataRestApplication.java[tag=code]
----

假设前面class以及Maven build文件是从http://start.spring.io生成的,你现在可以在IDE里面运行`main()`方法,或者在命令行运行`./mvnw spring-boot:run` . (mvnw.bat 是windows版本).

NOTE: 如果你不了解Spring Boot的原理, 你应该看一下 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbPSjI4tt10[Josh Long的介绍性介绍]. 

== 浏览你的REST服务

With the app running, you can check things out on the command line using
你可以使用命令行工具 http://curl.haxx.se/[cURL]查看一些内容 (或其他你喜欢的工具).

----
$ curl localhost:8080/api
{
  "_links" : {
    "employees" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/employees"
    },
    "profile" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/profile"
    }
  }
}
----

当你ping根节点时,会返回以 http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL格式的JSON文档]包装的链接集合.

* *_links* 是一个可用链接的集合.
* *employees* 指向 `EmployeeRepository` 接口定义的员工对象集合
* *profile* 是一个IANA标准的关系, 指向关于整个服务的可发现的元数据.在后文我们将会一一展开.

通过浏览 *employees* 链接可以进一步了解该服务.

----
$ curl localhost:8080/api/employees
{
  "_embedded" : {
    "employees" : [ {
      "firstName" : "Frodo",
      "lastName" : "Baggins",
      "description" : "ring bearer",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1"
        }
      }
    } ]
  }
}
----

At this stage, you are viewing the entire collection of employees.

What's included along with the data you pre-loaded earlier is a *_links* attribute with a *self* link. This is the canonical link for that particular employee. What is canonical? It means free of context. For example, the same user could be fetched through a link like /api/orders/1/processor, in which the employee is assocated with processing a particular order. Here, there is no relationship to other entities.

IMPORTANT: Links are a critical facet of REST. They provide the power to navigate to related items. It makes it possible for other parties to navigate around your API without having to rewrite things everytime there is a change. Updates in the client is a common problem when the clients hard code paths to resources. Restructuring resources can cause big upheavals in code. If links are used and instead the navigation route is maintained, then it becomes easy and flexible to make such adjustments.

You can decide to view that one employee if you wish.

----
$ curl localhost:8080/api/employees/1
{
  "firstName" : "Frodo",
  "lastName" : "Baggins",
  "description" : "ring bearer",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1"
    }
  }
}
----

Little change here, except that there is no need for the *_embedded* wrapper since there is only domain object.

That's all and good, but you are probably itching to create some new entries.

----
$ curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/employees -d "{\"firstName\": \"Bilbo\", \"lastName\": \"Baggins\", \"description\": \"burglar\"}" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
{
  "firstName" : "Bilbo",
  "lastName" : "Baggins",
  "description" : "burglar",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/employees/2"
    }
  }
}
----

You can also PUT, PATCH, and DELETE as shown in https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-rest/[this related guide]. But let's not dig into that. You have already spent way too much time interacting with this REST service manually. Don't you want to build a slick UI instead?

== Setting up a custom UI controller

Spring Boot makes it super simple to stand up a custom web page. First, you need a Spring MVC controller.

.src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/payroll/HomeController.java
[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/payroll/HomeController.java[tag=code]
----

* `@Controller` marks this class as a Spring MVC controller.
* `@RequestMapping` flags the `index()` method to support the `/` route.
* It returns `index` as the name of the template, which Spring Boot's autoconfigured view resolver will map to `src/main/resources/templates/index.html`.

== Defining an HTML template

You are using Thymeleaf, although you won't really use many of its features.

.src/main/resources/templates/index.html
[source,html]
----
include::src/main/resources/templates/index.html[]
----

The key part in this template is the `<div id="react"></div>` component in the middle. It is where you will direct React to plug in the rendered output.

== Loading JavaScript modules

This tutorial won't go into extensive detail on how it uses https://webpack.github.io/[webpack] to load JavaScript modules. But thanks to the *frontend-maven-plugin*, you don't _have_ to install any of the node.js tools to build and run the code.

The following JavaScript modules will be used:

* webpack
* babel
* react.js
* rest.js

With the power of babel, the JavaScript is written in ES6.

If you're interested, the paths for the JavaScript modules are defined in https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-react-and-spring-data-rest/blob/master/basic/webpack.config.js[webpack.config.js]. This is then used by webpack to generate a JavaScript bundle, which is loaded inside the template. 

NOTE: Want to see your JavaScript changes automatically? Run `npm run-script watch` to put webpack into watch mode. It will regenerate bundle.js as you edit the source.

With all that in place, you can focus on the React bits which are fetched after the DOM is loaded. It's broken down into parts as below:

Since you are using webpack to assemble things, go ahead and fetch the modules you need:

.src/main/js/app.js
[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/js/app.js[tag=vars]
----

* `React` is the main library from Facebook for building this app.
* `client` is custom code that configures rest.js to include support for HAL, URI Templates, and other things. It also sets the default *Accept* request header to *application/hal+json*. You can https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-react-and-spring-data-rest/blob/master/basic/src/main/js/client.js[read the code here].

== Diving into React

React is based on defining components. Oftentimes, one component can hold multiple instances of another in a parent-child relationship. It's easy for this concept to extend several layers. 

To start things off, it's very handy to have a top level container for all components. (This will become more evident as you expand upon the code throughout this series.) Right now, you only have the employee list. But you might need some other related components later on, so let's start with this:

.src/main/js/app.js - App component
[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/js/app.js[tag=app]
----

* `class Foo extends React.Component{...}` is the method to create a React component.
* `componentDidMount` is the API invoked after React renders a component in the DOM.
* `render` is the API to "draw" the component on the screen.

NOTE: In React, uppercase is the convention for naming components.

In the *App* component, an array of employees is fetched from the Spring Data REST backend and stored in this component's *state* data.

[[NOTE]]
====
React components have two types of data: *state* and *properties*. 

*State* is data that the component is expected to handle itself. It is also data that can fluctuate and change. To read the state, you use `this.state`. To update it, you use `this.setState()`. Every time `this.setState()` is called, React updates the state, calculates a diff between the previous state and the new state, and injects a set of changes to the DOM on the page. This results a fast and efficient updates to your UI. 

The common convention is to initialize state with all your attributes empty in the constructor. Then you lookup data from the server using `componentDidMount` and populate your attributes. From there on, updates can be driven by user action or other events.

*Properties* encompass data that is passed into the component. Properties do NOT change but are instead fixed values. To set them, you assign them to attributes when creating a new component and you'll soon see.

WARNING: JavaScript doesn't lock down data structures like other languages. You can try to subvert properties by assigning values, but this doesn't work with React's differential engine and should be avoided.
====

In this code, the function loads data via `client`, a https://promisesaplus.com/[Promise compliant] instance of rest.js. When it is done retrieving from `/api/employees`, it then invokes the function inside `done()` and set's the state based on it's HAL document (`response.entity._embedded.employees`). You might remember the structure of `curl /api/employees` <<Touring your REST service,earlier>> and see how it maps onto this structure.

When the state is updated, the `render()` function is invoked by the framework. The employee state data is included in creation of the `<EmployeeList />` React component as an input parameter.

Below is the definition for an `EmployeeList`.

.src/main/js/app.js - EmployeeList component
[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/js/app.js[tag=employee-list]
----

Using JavaScript's map function, `this.props.employees` is transformed from an array of employee records into an array of `<Element />` React components (which you'll see a little further down). 

[source,javascript]
----
<Employee key={employee._links.self.href} data={employee} />
----

This shows a new React component (note the uppercase format) being created along with two properties: *key* and *data*. These are supplied the values from `employee._links.self.href` and `employee`.

IMPORTANT: Whenever you work with Spring Data REST, the *self* link IS the key for a given resource. React needs a unique identifer for child nodes, and `_links.self.href` is perfect.

Finally, you return an HTML table wrapped around the array of `employees` built with mapping.

[source,html]
----
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>First Name</th>
        <th>Last Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    {employees}
</table>
----

This simple layout of state, properties, and HTML shows how React lets you declaritively create a simple and easy-to-understand component.

[[NOTE]]
====
Does this code contain both HTML _and_ JavaScript? Yes, this is https://facebook.github.io/js/[JSX]. There is no requirement to use it. React can be written using pure JavaScript, but the JSX syntax is quite terse. Thanks to rapid work on the Babel.js, the transpiler provides both JSX and ES6 support all at once

JSX also includes bits and pieces of http://es6-features.org/#Constants[ES6]. The one used in the code is the http://es6-features.org/#ExpressionBodies[arrow function]. It avoids creating a nested function() with its own scoped *this*, and avoids needing a http://stackoverflow.com/a/962040/28214[*self* variable].

Worried about mixing logic with your structure? React's APIs encourage nice, declarative structure combined with state and properties. Instead of mixing a bunch of unrelated JavaScript and HTML, React encourages building simple components with small bits of related state and properties that work well together. It lets you look at a single component and understand the design. Then they are easy to combine together for bigger structures.
====

Next, you need to actually define what an `<Employee />` is.

.src/main/js/app.js - Employee component
[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/js/app.js[tag=employee]
----

This component is very simple. It has a single HTML table row wrapped around the employee's three properties. The property itself is `this.props.employee`. Notice how passing in a JavaScript object makes it easy to pass along data fetched from the server?

Because this component doesn't manage any state nor does it deal with user input, there is nothing else to do. This might tempt you to cram it into the `<EmployeeList />` up above. Don't do it! Instead, splitting your app up into small components that each do one job will make it easier to build up functionality in the future.

The last step is to render the whole thing.

.src/main/js/app.js - rendering code
[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/js/app.js[tag=render]
----

`React.render()` accepts two arguments: a React component you defined as well as a DOM node to inject it into. Remember how you saw the `<div id="react"></div>` item earlier from the HTML page? This is where it gets picked up and plugged in.

With all this in place, re-run the application (`./mvnw spring-boot:run`) and visit http://localhost:8080.

image::https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-react-and-spring-data-rest/raw/master/basic/images/basic-1.png[]

You can see the initial employee loaded up by the system.

Remember using cURL to create new entries? Do that again.

----
curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/employees -d "{\"firstName\": \"Bilbo\", \"lastName\": \"Baggins\", \"description\": \"burglar\"}" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
----

Refresh the browser, and you should see the new entry:

image::https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-react-and-spring-data-rest/raw/master/basic/images/basic-2.png[]

And now you can see both of them listed on the web site.

== Review

In this section:

* You defined a domain object and a corresponding repository.
* You let Spring Data REST export it with full blown hypermedia controls. 
* You created two simple React components in a parent-child relationship.
* You fetched server data and rendered them in as a simple, static HTML structure.

Issues?

* The web page wasn't dynamic. You had to refresh the browser to fetch new records.
* The web page didn't use any hypermedia controls or metadata. Instead, it was hardcoded to fetch data from `/api/employees`.
* It's read only. While you can alter records using cURL, the web page offers none of that.

These are things we can address in the next section.
